# score_comparison
Performs linear regression to determine correlation between Math placement scores and Math ACT scores.

##### Data
The data used in this project comes from data collected from Pepperdine Students in 2019. It reports data on ACT scores, math and reading placement test scores, gender, major, cumulative GPA, and grades earned in specific classes. This could be reproduced using other datasets to see if ACT scores correlate to placement tests on a broader university scale.

##### Interpretation
This project looks at whether a student's math ACT score has any correlation to how they did on the math placement exam. The broader extent of the research was to determine the relevance of looking at ACT score to measure a student's academic performance. We found that ACT and math placement scores were linearly correlated.
